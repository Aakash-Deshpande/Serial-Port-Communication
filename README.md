# Serial-Port-Communication
Using Serial Port Communication via micro controller to display accurate time.

This code should be debugged on Code Composer Studio(CCS) after connecting TI MSP432 microcontroller. After connecting the board go to
Device Manager and see on which port the board is connected.

To look at the displayed time we need an app called - PuTTy(Telnet and SSH client).

Link to download PuTTy - https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html .
After installing it select the option - Serial.
Enter the port number e.g: COM4 and select the baud rate as 115200 and click Open.
You should be able to see the time.
